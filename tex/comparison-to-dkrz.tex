\label{sect:jupyter-at-dkrz}

In the following, the Jupyter-based solutions provided by DKRZ\footnote{Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum} are investigated.
First, a brief overview on the available compute infrastructure is given, then the officially supported Jupyter-based access options are described.
The goal is to enable a comprehensive discussion of the JupyterHub@JSC from a more general Jupyter@HPC viewpoint.

\label{s-introductoin}

Jupyter notebooks~\citep{Kluyver2016} are increasingly used for scientific work.
Services like Binder~\citep{Jupyter2018}, colab \citep{Google2020, Carneiro2018}, or the Pangeo hubs\citep{robinson2019science}, that are based on public cloud infrastructure, are setting high standards for user experience (ELABORATE ON UX ON BINDER, COLAB, PANGEO?).
There are numerous efforts to establish Jupyter based workflows in HPC centres or on-premise cloud infrastructure:
\begin{itemize}
  \item NCAR runs it on CHEYNENNE\footnote{https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/computational-systems/cheyenne/software/jupyter-and-ipython},
  \item DKRZ offers a JupyterHub\footnote{https://www.dkrz.de/up/systems/mistral/programming/jupyter-notebook},
  \item and JSC has a solution~\citep{Goebbert2018}.
\end{itemize}

From a user perspective, notebooks may be attractive because they allow for combining a narrative with technical details, code, data and figures and hence provide an integrated way of presenting a line of scientific reasoning, and because they can be created in an incremental and interactive process that in some cases is close the the thought process during scientific work.

Jupyter may be attractive for users because though originating from the Python ecosystem, it provides a common interface for creating notebooks that can contain code in many different languages.
Work with remote Jupyter instances, e.g., through a JupyterHub is popular, because the browser-based graphical application is executed on the user's computer and the bandwidth and stability requirements for the connection to the server are minimal and result in a low-latency and smooth user experience that is rare among classical GUIs that allow for execution on remote servers.

Besides Jupyter, there are other popular implementations of computational notebooks~\citep{Hinsen2019a} that increasingly provide a browser-based way of working with them\footnote{See, e.g., the Matlab Live Editor at https://de.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html.}.

In this paper, we evaluate the JSC JupyterHub with respect to {\em Documentation}, {\em Accessibility}, {\em Flexibility}, {\em Availability}, and {\em Stability}.
Throughout the evaluation, the question if the service does or does not lead to an increase in productivity for scientists will be the guiding criterion.


\subsection{User requirements}

Jupyter on HPC is a solution for different user groups that profit for different reasons.
There is expert users who have substantial resource demands (computational power or storage which can only be provided by HPC) and who don't want to miss the familiar comfort of the integrated working environment (notebooks and visualization but also terminal access) provided by Jupyter.
But Juptyer can also bring non-expert users to HPC who lack the technical background to fully build their own commandline-based workflows, but who \emph{can} do meaningful science with the data and group or community specific toolboxes already available there.
While for expert users, it's easy to work with Jupyter on HPC without relying on a central service\footnote{see, e.g, https://git.geomar.de/python/jupyter_on_HPC_setup_guide}, for non-experts a JupyterHub service may be essential for opening up the HPC system at all.

Users will expect different levels of customizability, all of which are essential to at least some of the users.
Some users will want immediately usable default software environments and default resource choices that don't require intimate knowledge of HPC specifics.
Others will need full customizability not only f to the underlying Jupyter kernel and frontend software environment, but also of the spawning location.
These users might want access to all resources and to every specific part (e.g., GPU or large-memory nodes) of the HPC system that they could use with classical command-line access.

For all user groups, the provided documentation needs to be up-to-date with the JSC specific default state of the JupyterLab user interface.
The documentation should also be in sync with community documentation and best practices, because users are unlikely to be only exposed to Juptyer on one single datacentre.

Providing interactive access to HPC resources brings high demands in terms of availability of resources and of stability, which are more difficult to fulfil the more specific the needs of the users are.
Providing a way to fore-see availability of resources and hence plannable interactive sessions may help.


\subsection{Resulting technical requirements}

% TODO: Make much shorter here and move long form to discussion?

The above user requirements can be broken down into different aspects all or most of which can be solved with a JupyterHub but which should be understood separately:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Remote access:}  Users want to operate a personal computer and have a way of starting execution on an HPC machine, capturing the results to be displayed on their personal computer.
  \item \textbf{Minimal software requirements on the user side:}  The computers users can access directly are very diverse.  Most of them, however, do have a web browser.
  \item \textbf{Web based software on the server side:}  Most computational notebook tools provide a built-in\footnote{For others there may be a way of using, e.g., https://novnc.com/info.html.} way of directly connecting to them via HTTP/HTTPS.
  \item \textbf{Ability to chose arbitrary resources:}  The resource requirements range from very low memory and CPU demands that could easily be fulfilled on a shared machine to requiring multiple HPC nodes or special hardware like GPUs.
\end{itemize}

% TODO: Filter out the hub-specific requirements and merge this with the user requirements section above.

A typical JupyterHub-based session in an HPC centre may work as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Authentication:} The user logs in to a JupyterHub that provides different choices for the actual Jupyter session.
  \item \textbf{Spawning of a server:} The user choses how to work (resources, duration, machine, account, project etc.) and the JupyterHub starts spawning a Jupyter user server on the selected HPC resources.
  This may take time (seconds to hours / days).
  \item \textbf{Connection to the user server:} When the user server is ready, the user is connected or provided with a link to connect to the user server.
  The web browser downloads the Jupyter software and starts the Jupyter interface on the user's computer.
  \item \textbf{Starting a kernel:} After possibly using other ways of working with the Jupyter user server\footnote{There is, e.g., a basic file system browser, a text editor, a terminal, etc. built into Jupyter.}, the user opens a notebook and explicitly or implicitly choses and starts a Jupyter kernel process which will execute the code entered by the user.
  The user may open more than one notebook and work with more than one kernel process.
  Kernels can be stopped and restarted by the user.
  \item \textbf{Exporting and downloading the notebook:} When done with all or parts of the desired work, the user may export one or more notebooks to different formats (including the native notebook format) and download them to their personal computer.
  \item \textbf{Stopping the user server:} The user server can be stopped by the user (from within the Jupyter server or from the JupyterHub), by the HPC resource manager (because of time or other resource limit violation), or by the JupyterHub.
  \item \textbf{Disconnecting:} The user disconnects from the Jupyter user server by, e.g., closing the browser tab.
  In a next or in the same step, the user also could disconnect from or log out of the JupyterHub.
\end{itemize}

It should be noted that the notion of \emph{Jupyter user server} can be very broad.
There is applications\footnote{e.g., https://github.com/ideonate/jhsingle-native-proxy} that can be spawned by JupyterHub that do not require a Jupyter notebook at all.
In this case, the JupyterHub serves as little more than a proxy to an arbitrary web app on the HPC resources that provides convenient ways of authenticating, and chosing apps and resources.

\subsection{Key service challenges}

(For web-based access to HPC resources.)

\begin{itemize}
  \item What are the technical obstacles to overcome from a user perspective? And from an HPC operator perspective?
  \item ...
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cautionary note}

(We should mention that what we discuss here is formulated entirely from a user perspective and that we do not have detailed administrator insight into service configurations. Should probably be moved away from the introduction.) (We should also briefly explain why we take the "subjective" JupyterHub@JSC perspective.)
(We should also say that our "research objects" gradually changed during the evaluation period, and that some information provided here will and might have become obsolete.)

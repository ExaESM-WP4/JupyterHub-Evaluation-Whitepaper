\section{Introduction}
\label{s-introductoin}

Jupyter notebooks~\citep{Kluyver2016} are increasingly used for scientific work.
Services like Binder~\citep{Jupyter2018}, colab \citep{Google2020, Carneiro2018}, or the Pangeo hubs\citep{robinson2019science}, that are based on public cloud infrastructure, are setting high standards for user experience (ELABORATE ON UX ON BINDER, COLAB, PANGEO?).
There are numerous efforts to establish Jupyter based workflows in HPC centres or on-premise cloud infrastructure:
\begin{itemize}
  \item NCAR runs it on CHEYNENNE\footnote{https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/computational-systems/cheyenne/software/jupyter-and-ipython},
  \item DKRZ offers a JupyterHub\footnote{https://www.dkrz.de/up/systems/mistral/programming/jupyter-notebook},
  \item and JSC has a solution~\citep{Goebbert2018}.
\end{itemize}

In this paper, we evaluate the JSC JupyterHub with respect to {\em Documentation}, {\em Accessibility}, {\em Flexibility}, {\em Availability}, and {\em Stability}.

\subsection{User requirements}

(Might be formulated as user stories, both covering present and desired future workflows.)

\subsection{Key service challenges}

(For web-based access to HPC resources.)

\begin{itemize}
  \item What are the technical obstacles to overcome from a user perspective? And from an HPC operator perspective?
  \item ...
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cautionary note}

(We should mention that what we discuss here is formulated entirely from a user perspective and that we do not have detailed administrator insight into service configurations. Should probably be moved away from the introduction.) (We should also briefly explain why we take the "subjective" JupyterHub@JSC perspective.)
(We should also say that our "research objects" gradually changed during the evaluation period, and that some information provided here will and might have become obsolete.)

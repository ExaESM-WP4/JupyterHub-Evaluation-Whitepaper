Several HPC system operators have started to provide web-based access solutions to HPC compute/storage infrastructure.
Implementation options are immense and system providers need to consider and strongly need to weigh aspects such as implementation effort/cost, security, maintainability, ... against target user service usability.
Thus, services might not turn out to be optimal in supporting user productivity.
Here, scientific user producivity/usability requirements are formulated and existing web-based access solutions to HPC resources are evaluated against these requirements.
Suggestions are given that are targeted not only at maximizing the productivity of scientific target users, but also at minimizing system provider/administator workload/manual intervention.
This white paper aims at closing a gap in ... [final words here].

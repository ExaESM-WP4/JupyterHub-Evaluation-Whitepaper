\section{Outlook}

(Are there any implications for the design of HPC infrastructure? Maybe treat these aspects in the discussion.)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Hardware infrastructure
  \item Software/OS configuration
  \item Queue/System node design
  \item Added cloud-like resources right next to the HPC machine (like HDFCoud)
\end{itemize}
